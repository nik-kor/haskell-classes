# Few words about us

* @Nikita works as FE chapter lead in SCM, experience with haskell < 1 year
* @Nikolas - works as director of mobile engineering, haskell as a hobby since 2006

---

# Format of workshop

* Some short presentation 3-5 min
* Practice - working together
* Repeat step 0

---

# Format of workshop

* concat . repeat $ ["presentation", "practice"]

---

# Plans?

* to have 2-3 more workshops about Haskell

---

## Main goal of these classes is to

# Demystify Haskell

---

## Goals for today

* Introduce to the language
* Show tools
* Basic syntax

---

# Basic Syntax

* Define a variable
 * `a :: Int` or Bool, String, Double
 * `a = 5`
* Use a variable (e.g in definition of other variable)
 * `b :: Int`
 * `b = 2 * a`

---

# Basic Syntax
 
* Define a function
 * `f :: Int -> Int`
 * `f x = 2 * x`
* Call a function
 * `f 5` = 10
* Assign to new variable
 * `b :: Int`
 * `b = f 5`

---

# Basic Syntax

* Define another function
 * `g :: (Int, Int) -> Int`
 * `g (x,y) = x + y`
* Currying
 * `g' :: Int -> (Int -> Int)`
 * `g' x y = x + y`
* Calling
 * `g' 4 5` = 9

---

# Basic Syntax

* Right associative:
 * `Int -> (Int -> Int)` â‰¡ `Int -> Int -> Int`
 * `(Int -> Int) -> Int` â‰  `Int -> Int -> Int`
* Partial application
 * `g' 5` :: Int -> Int
 * `(g' 5) 4` = 9

---

# Practice

* define a few variables of different types
* mutate a variable
* define a few functions of different types
* call them
* convert the following C-code to Haskell
 * int calculateFive(void) { return 5 }
 * int five = calculateFive()

---

## One-slide Haskell overview

* Immutability
* Purity (different type "IO" to do I/O)
* Functional
* Statically Strong-typed with type inference (no runtime types/reflection*)
* Lazy evaluation - examples?
* Algebraic Data Types ("objects" possible, but unusual)
* Pattern Matching
* Type classes: Principled overloading
* Non-null by default

---

# Immutability

* all variables are constants
* updating data structures returns a modified copy
* modifying variables in loops is solved by recursion/folds

---

# Purity (side effect free computations)

* output of function depends only on input
* referencial transparency
* out-of-the-box thread safety
* 90% of your app will be pure computations/constants
* Type IO will allow mutation/side effects for the 10%

---

# Functional

* programming with functions (mathematics, no side-effects)
* functions are first class citizens
  * pass as parameter to function
  * return them as result of a function (e.g. done in currying)
  * store in variable
  * compose them like LEGO <- this is where the power is
  
--- 

## Function composition

* `.`: compose - operator (there are more)
 * `f (g x)` = `(f . g) x`
 * `(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c`
 * `(length . name) person` (no magic OOP `.` operator)

---

## Function composition

* Example sorting an array of Persons
 * `persons.sorted{ $0.address.street.length < $1.address.street.length }` (Swift)
 * `sortBy (compare 'on' (length.street.address)) persons` (Haskell)
* Example saving the sort function for later
 * `var mysort = { persons in persons.sorted{ $0.age < $1.age }}` (Swift)
 * `mysort = sortBy (compare 'on' age)` (Haskell)

---

## Abstraction

* Example reversing the words in a string
 * `unwords . map reverse . words`
* Example quicksort

        quicksort [] = []
        quicksort (x:xs) = quicksort small ++ (x : quicksort large)
          where small = [y | y <- xs, y <= x]
                large = [y | y <- xs, y > x]

---

# Type system

* Types exist only at compile time
* No types at run time (apart form language extensions)
* type inferrer figures out _everything_ correctly, if you don't provide types
* Be easy on your future self: Better provide types!

---

# Lazy evaluation

* allows infinite data structure
 * `repeat '1'` = "1111111111111
 * `take 5 (repeat '1')` = "11111"
 * `zip [1..] items` = [(1,item0),(2,item1) no counter needed
* only computes, what is necessary
 * e.g. `head . filter (>5)` stops at first matching item
* Allows separation of creating data structure and consuming it (e.g. decision tree in a game)

---

# Practice: create some infinite data structures and consume them

* use `repeat`, `[1,3..]`, `map`, `take`, `head`
* use `Ctrl-C`, if you tried printing the whole structure to Terminal

---

# Algebraic Data Types

---

# Pattern Matching

---

# Practice

* create a data structure
* create an instance
* pattern match one of its records
* update it
* mutate it ðŸ˜œ

-- 

# Type classes: Principled overloading
# Non-null by default

---

## Problems with Haskell
* Updating Data Structure (solution: Lenses libraries)
* No out-of-the-box String Interpolation
* Foreigner on lots of platforms
* Big but not abundant ecosystem/community

---

## Haskell syntax compared to other languges

* Swift - TODO add snippets as an example
* Scala - compare with haskell


---

# Myths about Haskell

* I need to know Category Theory
* It's only for education

---

## Comparison of FP languages

# A lab for academia research

* Haskell has its roots in academia
* Haskell is a large language with a small Core
* Haskell can be augmented with language extensions
* Many compilers are written in Haskell (e.g. Elm, Idris, Agda, Purescript)

# Practical part

---

## GHCi 101

* `:t`
* `:i`
* `:r`
* `:l`
* `:h`

---

## Hello world

* `main`
* `print`

---

## Ex #1

* discover types for `main` and `print`

---

# Functions

* can you parse `a b c d` :)
* variables

---

## Ex #2

* write your own function `add` that sums 2 numbers
* add call it inside GHCi

---

## Types declaration

* `myCoolFunc :: Int -> (String -> Float) -> Bool -> [Int]`
* parametric polymorthism - `id :: a -> a`
* currying

---

## Ex #3

* let's check the types of `print` and `main` again
* declare type for your `add` function
* make a function `add10` by partially applying to `add`

---

## Functions application & composition

* `.`
* `$`
* TODO - add example with sorting

---

## Ex #4

* write another function `sub10` by partially applying `sub :: Int -> Int -> Int`
* compose `sub10` with `add10`

---

## Higher order functions

* `foldr`

---

## Ex #5

* use `map` to add 5 to each item of a list of integers

---

## Pattern matching

Let's implement them:

* `add :: (a, a) -> a`
* `head' :: [a] -> a`
* `map'`

---

## Ex #6

* implement `sub' :: (a, a) -> a` with pattern matching
* write your version of `tail' :: [a] -> [a]`

---

# Custom types

* Product
* Sum

---

## Product

* example of <a target='_blank' href='https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-prim-0.3.1.0/docs/src/GHC-Tuple.html'>tuple data type </a>
* Records

---

## Ex #7

* use `Product` instead of tuple in `add :: (a, a) -> a`

---

## Sum

* `Bool`
* `Maybe`
* `Either`

---

## Ex #8

* write safe version of head using `Maybe` - so `safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a`

---

## Following topics

 - recursion and recursive datastructures
 - type classes
 - Lists, Functors
 - Monoids
 - Monads

// parser example
// bad example: string interpolation, updating records, named parameters, guard let


extension Swift.Optional {
    func bind<B>(_ f: (Wrapped) -> B?) -> B? {
        return map(f) ?? nil
    }
}

return (countrySelectorButton.value as? String).bind(LocaleCode.init)
Value of type 'String?' has no member 'bind'
return LocaleCode(rawValue: (countrySelectorButton.value as? String) ?? "")
        guard let str = countrySelectorButton.value as? String else {
            return nil
        }
        return LocaleCode(rawValue: str)

Swift: Unable to infer complex closure return type; add explicit type to disambiguate
Haskell: If it is possible to infer, it will infer. If not, it will slap your face until you fix your stuff.
